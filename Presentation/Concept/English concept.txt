2. Introduction:
What is a Voice Command Calculator? Explain the concept of performing calculations using voice input.
Why Python? Discuss Python's suitability for speech recognition and calculator development (e.g., libraries, ease of use).
Problem Statement: Highlight the benefits of a voice-activated calculator (e.g., accessibility, convenience).

3. Technologies Used:
Speech Recognition Library: Detail the chosen library (e.g., SpeechRecognition, AssemblyAI, DeepSpeech). Explain why it was selected.
Text-to-Speech Library (Optional): If the calculator provides voice feedback (e.g., pyttsx3).
Core Python Libraries: Mention operator for mathematical operations.
GUI Library (Optional): If a graphical user interface is implemented (e.g., Tkinter).

4. System Architecture/Flow:
Diagram: A simple flowchart or block diagram illustrating the data flow:
Voice Input -> Speech Recognition -> Text Conversion -> Parsing/Operation Identification -> Calculation -> Result (Optional: Text-to-Speech Output).
Explanation of each stage.

5. Implementation Details:
Key Code Snippets:
Showcase essential parts of the code:
Initializing the recognizer and microphone.
Listening for audio input.
Converting speech to text.
Parsing the input string to extract numbers and operators.
Performing the calculation.
Handling potential errors (e.g., UnknownValueError).
Challenges Faced & Solutions:
Discuss any difficulties encountered during development and how they were overcome.

6. Demonstration:
Live Demo (Recommended): Show the calculator in action.
Screenshots/Video (Alternative): If a live demo is not possible.

7. Features & Capabilities:
Supported Operations: List the mathematical operations the calculator can perform (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus).
User Experience: Discuss ease of use and accessibility.

8. Future Enhancements:
